**Current Capability Assessment**: Ready for controlled test flights with basic guidance. Advanced operational flights require telemetry and enhanced guidance algorithms.

### Redundant Apogee Detection
To ensure the highest reliability for parachute deployment, the firmware now employs a multi-method apogee detection strategy. This system is designed to detect apogee accurately and within two seconds of the event, even in the case of a single sensor malfunction. Apogee is triggered if any of the following conditions are met:

1.  **Primary: Barometric Pressure:**
    *   **Method:** The primary and most sensitive method tracks the altitude from the MS5611 barometer. It records the maximum altitude reached during the flight.
    *   **Trigger:** Apogee is confirmed if the barometer registers a specific number of consecutive readings (`APOGEE_CONFIRMATION_COUNT`) that are lower than the maximum recorded altitude. This indicates the rocket has started its descent.

2.  **Secondary: Accelerometer Freefall:**
    *   **Method:** A secondary check uses the Z-axis of the ICM-20948 accelerometer. At apogee, the rocket experiences a brief period of near-zero gravity (freefall) as it transitions from upward to downward motion.
    *   **Trigger:** Apogee is confirmed if the accelerometer measures negative g-force on its vertical axis for a specific number of consecutive readings (`APOGEE_ACCEL_CONFIRMATION_COUNT`), indicating that the rocket is no longer accelerating upwards.

3.  **Tertiary: GPS Altitude:**
    *   **Method:** As a third layer of redundancy, the GPS module's altitude data is monitored. While typically having a slower update rate than the barometer, it provides an independent source of altitude information.
    *   **Trigger:** Similar to the barometer, if the GPS reports a number of consecutive altitude readings (`APOGEE_GPS_CONFIRMATION_COUNT`) lower than its previously recorded maximum, apogee is signaled. A 5-meter hysteresis is used to prevent triggering from GPS noise.

4.  **Failsafe: Backup Timer:**
    *   **Method:** A final, time-based failsafe ensures parachute deployment even if all other sensors fail to detect apogee. This timer starts at motor burnout (end of the `BOOST` phase).
    *   **Trigger:** If a pre-configured amount of time (`BACKUP_APOGEE_TIME_MS`, typically ~20 seconds) passes after motor burnout without any other method detecting apogee, the system will force an apogee event. This is a critical safety feature to prevent a total loss of the vehicle.

This layered approach ensures that the flight computer can reliably detect the peak of its flight and initiate recovery procedures under a wide range of conditions.
