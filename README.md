## Overview

TripleT Flight Firmware is an open-source flight controller software built for Teensy 4.0/4.1. It provides robust sensor integration, data logging, and a command-driven interface to configure and interact with your flight computer.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Microcontroller**: Teensy 4.0 or 4.1
- **Sensors**:
  - SparkFun ZOE-M8Q GPS Module (I2C address 0x42)
  - MS5611 Barometric Pressure Sensor (I2C address 0x77)
  - SparkFun KX134 Accelerometer (I2C address 0x1F)
  - SparkFun ICM-20948 9-DOF IMU (I2C address 0x69)
- **Storage**:
  - SD Card (connected via SPI on Teensy 4.0, via SDIO on Teensy 4.1)
- **Other Components**:
  - Optional: Buzzer (pin 23)
  - Optional: WS2812 LEDs (pin 7)
  - Optional: Servo motors for TVC (pins 0, 1)
  - Optional: Pyro channels (pins 5, 6, 7, 8)

## Features

- **Multi-sensor Integration**: Combined data from GPS, barometer, accelerometer, and 9-DOF IMU
- **Sensor Fusion**: Kalman filter-based sensor fusion for accurate orientation tracking
- **SD Card Logging**: Comprehensive data logging to SD card with CSV format
- **GPS/Barometer Calibration**: Automatic or manual calibration of barometric altitude based on GPS data
- **Comprehensive Data Collection**:
  - GPS position, altitude, speed, and fix quality
  - Barometric pressure, temperature, and calibrated altitude
  - High-G acceleration measurements
  - Orientation data from IMU (quaternions and Euler angles)
- **Interactive Serial Interface**: Command-driven system for data retrieval and configuration
- **Diagnostic Tools**: I2C scanner, sensor status reporting, and storage space monitoring
- **Configurable Debug Outputs**: Selectively enable/disable debug information for specific sensors

## Usage

### Basic Operation

On startup, the firmware:
1. Initializes all sensors and storage devices
2. Creates a new log file (with timestamp if GPS is available)
3. Begins collecting and logging sensor data

### Serial Commands

The firmware supports both single-character and extended commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `1-9`   | Toggle various debug outputs (system, IMU, GPS, barometer, etc.) |
| `a`     | Show help message |
| `b`     | Show system status |
| `f`     | Show storage statistics |
| `g`     | Toggle detailed display mode |
| `h`     | Calibrate barometer with GPS |
| `i`     | Display IMU data |
| `j`     | Toggle status summary |
| `debug_all_off` | Disable all debugging output |
| `calibrate` | Manually calibrate barometer with GPS |
| `help`  | Show help message |

### Debug Options

You can selectively enable/disable various debug outputs:

- System debug
- IMU debug
- GPS debug
- Barometer debug
- Storage debug
- Sensor fusion debug
- Quaternion debug
- Euler angles debug
- ICM raw debug

### Data Logging

Data is logged to the SD card in CSV format with the following information:
- Timestamp
- GPS information (fix type, satellites, position, altitude, speed)
- Barometric data (pressure, temperature)
- Accelerometer readings (X, Y, Z in g)
- IMU data (acceleration, gyro, magnetometer)
- Quaternion orientation values

### Barometer Calibration

The system supports calibration of the barometric altitude using GPS data:
- Automatic calibration when a good GPS fix is available
- Manual calibration via the `h` command or `calibrate` command
- Calibration status and values displayed in the barometer debug output
