## Usage

### Basic Operation

On startup, the firmware:
1. Initializes all sensors and storage devices
2. Creates a new log file (with timestamp if GPS is available)
3. Begins collecting and logging sensor data

### Serial Commands

The firmware supports both single-character and extended commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `0`     | Toggle serial CSV output |
| `1-9`   | Toggle various debug outputs (system, IMU, GPS, barometer, etc.) |
| `a`     | Show help message |
| `b`     | Show system status |
| `f`     | Show storage statistics |
| `g`     | Toggle detailed display mode |
| `h`     | Calibrate barometer with GPS |
| `i`     | Display IMU data |
| `j`     | Toggle status summary |
| `9`     | Initiate system shutdown |
| `debug_all_off` | Disable all debugging output |
| `calibrate` | Manually calibrate barometer with GPS |
| `help`  | Show help message |
| `arm`   | Arm the flight computer (transition to ARMED state) |
| `test_error` | Simulate sensor error (for testing) |
| `test_watchdog` | Simulate watchdog timeout (for testing) |
| `clear_errors` | Reset all error flags and return to normal operation |
| `status_sensors` | Display detailed sensor status information |

### Debug Options

You can selectively enable/disable various debug outputs:

- System debug
- IMU debug
- GPS debug
- Barometer debug
- Storage debug
- ICM raw debug
- Serial CSV output

### Data Logging

Data is logged to the SD card in CSV format with the following information:
- Timestamp
- GPS information (fix type, satellites, position, altitude, speed)
- Barometric data (pressure, temperature)
- Accelerometer readings (X, Y, Z in g)
- IMU data (acceleration, gyro, magnetometer)

### Barometer Calibration

The system supports calibration of the barometric altitude using GPS data:
- Automatic calibration when a good GPS fix is available (pDOP < 3.0)
- Requires stable sensor readings before attempting calibration
- Limited to 3 attempts with 30-second intervals between attempts
- Manual calibration via the `h` command or `calibrate` command
- Visual feedback via LED (purple during calibration, green for success, red for failure)
- Detailed debug output to diagnose calibration issues

### Configuration

Key firmware features can be configured by modifying `#define` statements in `src/config.h`:

- `ENABLE_WATCHDOG`: Set to `true` (default) to enable the hardware watchdog timer, which helps recover from system hangs. Set to `false` to disable the watchdog, which can be useful during debugging or testing when breakpoints might cause the watchdog to reset the system unintentionally.
- **Features & Hardware Presence**:
  - `DROGUE_PRESENT`: `true` if a drogue parachute is physically present and should be controlled.
  - `MAIN_PRESENT`: `true` if a main parachute is physically present and should be controlled.
  - `BUZZER_OUTPUT`: `true` to enable audible feedback via the buzzer.
  - `USE_KX134`: `true` to utilize the KX134 high-G accelerometer (typically alongside the ICM-20948).
- **Pin Definitions**:
  - `FLASH_CS_PIN`: Chip Select pin for the external serial flash memory (if used).
  - `NEOPIXEL_PIN`: Data pin for the WS2812 NeoPixel LEDs.
  - `BUZZER_PIN`: Pin connected to the buzzer.
- **NeoPixel Configuration**:
  - `NEOPIXEL_COUNT`: The number of NeoPixel LEDs connected.
- **Flight Logic Parameters**:
  - `MAIN_DEPLOY_ALTITUDE`: Target altitude (in meters Above Ground Level - AGL) for main parachute deployment.
  - `BOOST_ACCEL_THRESHOLD`: Acceleration threshold (in g) to detect liftoff.
  - `COAST_ACCEL_THRESHOLD`: Acceleration threshold (in g) to detect the end of the boost phase (motor burnout).
  - `APOGEE_CONFIRMATION_COUNT`: Number of consecutive readings required to confirm apogee detection.
  - `LANDING_CONFIRMATION_COUNT`: Number of consecutive readings required to confirm landing.
- **Sensor Error & Timeout Thresholds**:
  - `MAX_SENSOR_FAILURES`: General threshold for maximum sensor failures before marking a sensor as non-functional (currently used implicitly in some checks).
  - `BAROMETER_ERROR_THRESHOLD`: Maximum acceptable pressure change (in hPa) between consecutive barometer readings.
  - `ACCEL_ERROR_THRESHOLD`: Maximum acceptable acceleration change (in g) between consecutive accelerometer readings.
  - `GPS_TIMEOUT_MS`: Maximum time (in milliseconds) without a valid GPS update before considering the GPS to have failed.
- **Storage & Logging Configuration**:
  - `SD_CARD_MIN_FREE_SPACE`: Minimum required free space (in bytes) on the SD card for logging to continue.
  - `SD_CACHE_SIZE`: Cache size factor for SD card operations (used by SdFat).
  - `LOG_PREALLOC_SIZE`: Size (in bytes) to pre-allocate for the log file on the SD card to improve performance.
  - `DISABLE_SDCARD_LOGGING`: `true` to completely disable logging to the SD card (useful for testing without an SD card).
  - `MAX_LOG_ENTRIES`: Maximum number of log entries to buffer in RAM before forcing a flush to the SD card.
  - `FLUSH_INTERVAL`: Maximum time (in milliseconds) between flushes of the log buffer to the SD card, even if the buffer isn't full.
  - `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`: Maximum size (in bytes) allocated for a single log entry string in the RAM buffer.
  - `EXTERNAL_FLASH_MIN_FREE_SPACE`: Minimum required free space (in bytes) on the external flash memory (if used).
- **EEPROM Configuration**:
  - `EEPROM_STATE_ADDR`: Starting memory address in EEPROM where the flight state data is stored.
  - `EEPROM_SIGNATURE_VALUE`: A magic number used to validate the integrity of the data stored in EEPROM.
- **SD Card Driver Configuration (Board Specific)**:
  - These settings (`SD_CONFIG`, `SD_BUF_SIZE`, `SD_DETECT_PIN`, `SD_CS_PIN`) configure the SdFat library for the specific board (Teensy 4.1 SDIO or Teensy 4.0 SPI) and optimize performance. They are typically handled automatically based on the detected board type.
