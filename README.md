#### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - MISSING FEATURES
- ‚ùå **Hardware reference design**: Hardware platform design is still being worked on. 
- ‚ùå **Live Telemetry**: Radio communication system not implemented (critical for operational flights). Plan exists for ESP32 bridge.
- ‚ùå **Advanced Guidance**: Only basic attitude hold implemented; lacks trajectory following, gravity turns, wind compensation.

#### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - ENHANCEMENTS NEEDED
- üöß **Sensor Fusion Validation**: Kalman filter and sensor fusion implemented, but orientation accuracy needs validation against known reference data (physical testing).
- üöß **Expanded Sensor Support**: Extend the platform to allow for a wider variety of sensor hardware and eventually the microprocessor platform (Long term)

**Current Capability Assessment**: Code quality issues resolved. Ready for controlled test flights with robust attitude hold, comprehensive recovery systems, and extensive data logging. Advanced operational flights require telemetry and more sophisticated stabilisation / guidance algorithms.

### Compilation Status

  - Corrected variable name typos in GPS altitude detection

### Recovery System Enhancements
The Recovery state now includes comprehensive location aids:

1. **SOS Audio Beacon**: Repeating SOS pattern (¬∑¬∑¬∑---¬∑¬∑¬∑) using buzzer at configurable frequency
2. **LED Strobe Pattern**: High-visibility strobe pattern for visual location assistance
3. **GPS Coordinate Beacon**: Serial output of GPS coordinates for recovery teams
4. **Configurable Timing**: All patterns have individually configurable timing constants

### Redundant Apogee Detection
To ensure the highest reliability for parachute deployment, the firmware employs a multi-method apogee detection strategy. This system is designed to detect apogee accurately, even in the case of a single sensor malfunction. Apogee is triggered if any of the following conditions are met:

1.  **Primary: Barometric Pressure (`APOGEE_CONFIRMATION_COUNT`):**
    *   Tracks maximum altitude from MS5611. Apogee if current altitude is consistently lower than max.
2.  **Secondary: Accelerometer Freefall (`APOGEE_ACCEL_CONFIRMATION_COUNT`):**
    *   Uses ICM-20948 Z-axis. Apogee if negative g-force (freefall) is detected consecutively.
3.  **Tertiary: GPS Altitude (`APOGEE_GPS_CONFIRMATION_COUNT`):**
    *   Monitors u-blox GPS altitude. Apogee if GPS altitude is consistently lower than its recorded max (with hysteresis).
4.  **Failsafe: Backup Timer (`BACKUP_APOGEE_TIME_MS`):**
    *   Time-based failsafe starting at motor burnout. Forces apogee if other methods fail within the configured time.

This layered approach ensures that the flight computer can reliably detect the peak of its flight and initiate recovery procedures under a wide range of conditions.

## State Machine
The firmware operates on a 14-state state machine (see `State Machine.md` and `src/data_structures.h`) that dictates the rocket's behavior throughout its flight, from startup to recovery.

## Error Recovery System

The firmware includes comprehensive automatic sensor health monitoring and recovery mechanisms, primarily managed in `src/flight_logic.cpp` and `src/command_processor.cpp`:

- **Automatic Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring of critical sensors. If `isSensorSuiteHealthy()` (in `src/utility_functions.cpp`) reports a failure for the current operational state (excluding `LANDED`, `RECOVERY`, `ERROR`), the system transitions to the `ERROR` state.
- **Automatic Error Recovery**: While in the `ERROR` state, the system periodically checks (every 2 seconds via `autoRecoveryCheckInterval`) if sensor health has been restored (suitable for `PAD_IDLE` or `CALIBRATION`).
  - If healthy for `PAD_IDLE` (all systems go, barometer calibrated), transitions to `PAD_IDLE`.
  - If healthy for `CALIBRATION` (barometer initialized but needs calibration), transitions to `CALIBRATION`.
  - Recovery is prevented if critical hardware (e.g., barometer) is not initialized.
- **Manual Recovery Options**:
  - `clear_errors`: Attempts to transition from `ERROR` to `PAD_IDLE` if health checks pass.
  - `clear_to_calibration`: Attempts to transition from `ERROR` to `CALIBRATION` if the barometer is initialized but needs calibration.
- **Grace Period Protection**: A 5-second grace period (`errorClearGracePeriod`) is activated after clearing an error (manually or automatically) to prevent immediate re-entry into the `ERROR` state due to transient sensor fluctuations.
- **State Persistence**: The `FlightStateData` struct (including `g_main_deploy_altitude_m_agl`) is saved to EEPROM via `saveStateToEEPROM()` (in `src/state_management.cpp`) to survive power cycles and support recovery scenarios defined in `recoverFromPowerLoss()`.
- **Diagnostic Tools**: `isSensorSuiteHealthy()` provides verbose output for troubleshooting. Serial commands like `status_sensors` and debug flags offer detailed insights.

### Error State Behavior

When in `ERROR` state:
- System performs continuous health monitoring for automatic recovery.
- LED shows red error indication (managed by `setFlightStateLED` in `src/flight_logic.cpp`).
- Buzzer emits a fast beeping pattern (if `BUZZER_OUTPUT` enabled).
- Web interface (if connected) should reflect the `ERROR` state.
- Serial output provides diagnostic information if system debug is enabled.

### Recovery Process (Automatic)

1. **Detection**: `isSensorSuiteHealthy()` identifies if conditions for `PAD_IDLE` or `CALIBRATION` are met.
2. **State Decision**: System determines the appropriate target state.
3. **Transition**: Automatically transitions to `PAD_IDLE` or `CALIBRATION`.
4. **Grace Period**: Activates the 5-second grace period.
5. **Confirmation**: System logs the recovery and updates status indicators.

Key constants involved: `errorCheckInterval`, `autoRecoveryCheckInterval`, `errorClearGracePeriod`.

## Safety Features

- **Sensor Health Monitoring**: Continuous checks via `isSensorSuiteHealthy()`.
- **Redundant Apogee Detection**: Four independent methods (barometric, accelerometer, GPS, timer).
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic and manual recovery from `ERROR` state with grace period.
- **State Persistence**: Flight state (`FlightStateData`) saved to EEPROM for power-loss recovery.
- **Backup Timers**: Failsafe apogee detection timer (`BACKUP_APOGEE_TIME_MS`).
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed data logging (`LogData` struct) for post-flight analysis.
- **Dynamic Main Deployment Altitude**: Calculates main chute deployment altitude AGL at arming.

### Adding New Features
1. Define any new configurations in `src/config.h` or `src/constants.h`.
2. Implement core logic in a relevant existing module (e.g., `flight_logic.cpp` for state changes) or create a new `.cpp`/`.h` pair in `src/` for significant new functionality.
3. If user interaction is needed, add commands to `src/command_processor.cpp` and update `printHelpMessage()`.
4. If new data needs to be logged, update the `LogData` struct in `src/data_structures.h` AND the `LOG_COLUMNS` array in `src/log_format_definition.h` to maintain synchronization.
5. Test thoroughly, utilizing serial commands and debug flags for verification.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Sensor Initialization Failures**: Use `scan_i2c` to check connections. Verify power and I2C pull-up resistors.
- **GPS Not Getting Fix**: Ensure clear sky view. Allow time for cold start (can be several minutes). Check antenna connection. Use `debug_gps on` for u-blox messages.
- **SD Card Issues**: Verify card is FAT32 formatted. Check `sd_status` for available space and errors. Ensure `DISABLE_SDCARD_LOGGING` in `config.h` is `false`.
- **Compilation Errors**: Ensure all libraries in `platformio.ini` are correctly installed/updated. Check for missing includes or incorrect function signatures.
- **Unexpected State Transitions**: Enable `debug_system on` to trace state changes and sensor readings that might be causing them. Review `isSensorSuiteHealthy()` logic.

### Debug Commands
- Use `status_sensors` (or `b`) to check overall sensor health and initialization status.
- Enable specific debug flags (e.g., `debug_imu on`, `debug_gps on`, `debug_baro on`) for detailed output from sensor modules.
- Use `debug_serial_csv on` (or `0`) to see raw data being logged.
- Check SD card status and free space with `sd_status` (or `f`).
- Use `scan_i2c` to verify I2C device detection and addresses.
- Use `sensor_requirements` to understand what sensors are needed for each flight state.
- If in `ERROR` state, `clear_errors` or `clear_to_calibration` can be used after addressing the underlying issue.

## Error Codes

The firmware uses a system of error codes to help diagnose issues. When the system enters an `ERROR` state, or through certain status commands, the last recorded error code will be displayed. These codes are defined in `src/error_codes.h`.

| 60         | `BARO_CALIBRATION_FAIL_NO_GPS`    | Barometer calibration attempted but failed due to insufficient GPS fix (type or pDOP).         |
| 61         | `BARO_CALIBRATION_FAIL_TIMEOUT`   | Barometer calibration timed out waiting for a good GPS fix or valid pressure.                  |
| 62         | `MAG_CALIBRATION_LOAD_FAIL`       | Failed to load magnetometer calibration data from EEPROM (invalid signature/magic number).     |
| 70         | `STATE_TRANSITION_INVALID_HEALTH` | System health check (`isSensorSuiteHealthy`) failed, preventing a critical state transition or during initialization. |
| 71         | `ARM_FAIL_HEALTH_CHECK`           | Attempt to `arm` the system failed due to a health check failure for the ARMED state.          |
| 80         | `EEPROM_SIGNATURE_INVALID`        | EEPROM data for flight state recovery was found but had an invalid signature. Default state used. |
| 250        | `CONFIG_ERROR_MAIN_PARACHUTE`     | Example: `MAIN_PRESENT` is false in `config.h` (not currently enforced by an error code).    |
