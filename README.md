  - Limited retry mechanism to prevent infinite calibration loops
- **Flight State Machine**: Sophisticated flight state detection and management system
  - 14 distinct flight states from startup through recovery
  - Redundant detection methods for critical events (liftoff, apogee, landing)
  - Automatic state transitions with configurable parameters
- **Error Handling & Recovery**: Robust error detection and recovery mechanisms
  - Watchdog timer to prevent system lockups
  - Sensor health monitoring with graceful degradation
  - Automatic recovery procedures when possible
- **State Persistence**: EEPROM-based state storage for recovery from power loss or resets
  - Saves critical flight parameters (altitude, state, timestamps)
  - Automatic recovery to appropriate state after power interruption
- **Comprehensive Data Collection**:
  - GPS position, altitude, speed, and fix quality
  - Barometric pressure, temperature, and calibrated altitude
  - High-G acceleration measurements
  - Orientation data from IMU (quaternions and Euler angles).
  - Full orientation quaternions (q0, q1, q2, q3) and derived Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw) from the MARG filter.
  - PID controller internal states including commanded target Euler angles, integral term values, and final actuator output commands.
- **Interactive Serial Interface**: Command-driven system for data retrieval and configuration

- Requires stable sensor readings before attempting calibration
- Limited to 3 attempts with 30-second intervals between attempts
- Manual calibration via the `h` command or `calibrate` command
- Visual feedback via LED (purple during calibration, green for success, red for failure)
- Detailed debug output to diagnose calibration issues

### Configuration

Key firmware features can be configured by modifying `#define` statements in `src/config.h`:

- `ENABLE_WATCHDOG`: Set to `true` (default) to enable the hardware watchdog timer, which helps recover from system hangs. Set to `false` to disable the watchdog, which can be useful during debugging or testing when breakpoints might cause the watchdog to reset the system unintentionally.
- **Features & Hardware Presence**:
  - `DROGUE_PRESENT`: `true` if a drogue parachute is physically present and should be controlled.
  - `MAIN_PRESENT`: `true` if a main parachute is physically present and should be controlled.
  - `BUZZER_OUTPUT`: `true` to enable audible feedback via the buzzer.
  - `USE_KX134`: `true` to utilize the KX134 high-G accelerometer (typically alongside the ICM-20948).
- **Pin Definitions**:
  - `FLASH_CS_PIN`: Chip Select pin for the external serial flash memory (if used).
  - `NEOPIXEL_PIN`: Data pin for the WS2812 NeoPixel LEDs.
  - `BUZZER_PIN`: Pin connected to the buzzer.
- **NeoPixel Configuration**:
  - `NEOPIXEL_COUNT`: The number of NeoPixel LEDs connected.
- **Flight Logic Parameters**:
  - `MAIN_DEPLOY_ALTITUDE`: Target altitude (in meters Above Ground Level - AGL) for main parachute deployment.
  - `BOOST_ACCEL_THRESHOLD`: Acceleration threshold (in g) to detect liftoff.
  - `COAST_ACCEL_THRESHOLD`: Acceleration threshold (in g) to detect the end of the boost phase (motor burnout).
  - `APOGEE_CONFIRMATION_COUNT`: Number of consecutive readings required to confirm apogee detection.
  - `LANDING_CONFIRMATION_COUNT`: Number of consecutive readings required to confirm landing.
- **Sensor Error & Timeout Thresholds**:
  - `MAX_SENSOR_FAILURES`: General threshold for maximum sensor failures before marking a sensor as non-functional (currently used implicitly in some checks).
  - `BAROMETER_ERROR_THRESHOLD`: Maximum acceptable pressure change (in hPa) between consecutive barometer readings.
  - `ACCEL_ERROR_THRESHOLD`: Maximum acceptable acceleration change (in g) between consecutive accelerometer readings.
  - `GPS_TIMEOUT_MS`: Maximum time (in milliseconds) without a valid GPS update before considering the GPS to have failed.
- **Storage & Logging Configuration**:
  - `SD_CARD_MIN_FREE_SPACE`: Minimum required free space (in bytes) on the SD card for logging to continue.
  - `SD_CACHE_SIZE`: Cache size factor for SD card operations (used by SdFat).
  - `LOG_PREALLOC_SIZE`: Size (in bytes) to pre-allocate for the log file on the SD card to improve performance.
  - `DISABLE_SDCARD_LOGGING`: `true` to completely disable logging to the SD card (useful for testing without an SD card).
  - `MAX_LOG_ENTRIES`: Maximum number of log entries to buffer in RAM before forcing a flush to the SD card.
  - `FLUSH_INTERVAL`: Maximum time (in milliseconds) between flushes of the log buffer to the SD card, even if the buffer isn't full.
  - `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`: Maximum size (in bytes) allocated for a single log entry string in the RAM buffer.
  - `EXTERNAL_FLASH_MIN_FREE_SPACE`: Minimum required free space (in bytes) on the external flash memory (if used).
- **EEPROM Configuration**:
  - `EEPROM_STATE_ADDR`: Starting memory address in EEPROM where the flight state data is stored.
  - `EEPROM_SIGNATURE_VALUE`: A magic number used to validate the integrity of preoccupied data stored in EEPROM.

- **Madgwick Filter Configuration**:
  - `MADGWICK_BETA_INIT`: Initial beta value for the Madgwick filter. This gain determines the filter's overall responsiveness. Higher values rely more on accelerometer/magnetometer data, while lower values trust the gyroscope more.
  - `MADGWICK_BETA_STATIONARY`: Reduced beta value used when the system detects it is stationary. This promotes stability of the orientation estimate when there is no actual movement.
  - `MADGWICK_BETA_MOTION`: Increased beta value used when the system detects motion. This allows the filter to respond more quickly to changes in orientation.
  - `MADGWICK_GYRO_BIAS_LEARN_RATE`: Learning rate for the algorithm that estimates and compensates for gyroscope bias drift over time.

- **PID Controller & Actuator Configuration**:
  - `PID_ROLL_KP, PID_ROLL_KI, PID_ROLL_KD`: Proportional, Integral, and Derivative gains for the roll axis PID controller. These values tune the controller's response to roll errors.
  - `PID_PITCH_KP, PID_PITCH_KI, PID_PITCH_KD`: Proportional, Integral, and Derivative gains for the pitch axis PID controller.
  - `PID_YAW_KP, PID_YAW_KI, PID_YAW_KD`: Proportional, Integral, and Derivative gains for the yaw axis PID controller.
  - `PID_OUTPUT_MIN, PID_OUTPUT_MAX`: Minimum and maximum normalized output values for the PID controllers (e.g., -1.0 to 1.0). This limits the command sent to actuators.
  - `PID_INTEGRAL_LIMIT_ROLL, PID_INTEGRAL_LIMIT_PITCH, PID_INTEGRAL_LIMIT_YAW`: Anti-windup limits for the integral term of each PID axis. Prevents the integral term from growing too large, which can cause instability.
  - `ACTUATOR_PITCH_PIN, ACTUATOR_ROLL_PIN, ACTUATOR_YAW_PIN`: Microcontroller pin assignments for the pitch, roll, and yaw actuator servos.
  - `SERVO_MIN_PULSE_WIDTH, SERVO_MAX_PULSE_WIDTH`: Minimum and maximum pulse width (in microseconds) for servo control. These values define the servo's range of motion (typically 1000Âµs to 2000Âµs for 0-180 degrees).
  - `SERVO_DEFAULT_ANGLE`: Default angle (in degrees) to which servos are set upon initialization and when no specific command is active.

- **SD Card Driver Configuration (Board Specific)**:
  - These settings (`SD_CONFIG`, `SD_BUF_SIZE`, `SD_DETECT_PIN`, `SD_CS_PIN`) configure the SdFat library for the specific board (Teensy 4.1 SDIO or Teensy 4.0 SPI) and optimize performance. They are typically handled automatically based on the detected board type.

## Potential Improvements and Future Work

- [ ] **Persistent Magnetometer Calibration:** Implement a mechanism to save and load magnetometer calibration values (bias and scale) to/from EEPROM or the SD card. This would avoid the need for recalibration or manual code changes after each power cycle.
- [ ] **Advanced Flight State Machine for Guidance:** Integrate the dynamic target update system more deeply with a comprehensive flight state machine. Target orientations for the PID controllers should ideally be determined by the active flight phase (e.g., ascent, coast, specific pointing maneuvers, landing orientation).
- [ ] **UKF and MARG Synergy:** Review and clarify the roles of the existing 1D Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF for altitude/velocity) and the new 9-axis Madgwick (MARG for attitude). Explore options for tighter integration, such as using MARG attitude to improve the UKF's state estimation or extending the UKF to a full 3D state estimator.
- [ ] **Consolidate Helper Functions:** Resolve any duplicate helper functions (e.g., `convertQuaternionToEuler`) by ensuring a single, canonical version is used throughout the codebase, properly declared in a shared header.
- [ ] **Configurable Actuator Axis Mapping:** Provide clear documentation and potentially runtime or compile-time configuration options for mapping logical PID axes (X, Y, Z from `guidance_control`) to physical servo outputs and their corresponding control effects (e.g., which servo controls pitch, roll, or yaw, and in which direction).
- [ ] **Advanced PID Control Techniques:** Investigate and potentially implement advanced PID features such as derivative-on-measurement (to reduce setpoint kick), feedforward control (to improve response to known disturbances), or even auto-tuning capabilities.
- [ ] **Guidance System Failsafes:** Develop more specific error handling and failsafe mechanisms for the guidance and control system. This could include strategies for sensor disagreements, actuator saturation, or unexpected flight dynamics.
- [ ] **Refine `isStationary` Detection:** The current `isStationary` detection in `icm_20948_functions.cpp` relies on gyro magnitude and accelerometer variance. Its thresholds (`GYRO_THRESHOLD`, `ACCEL_VARIANCE_THRESHOLD`, `STATE_CHANGE_THRESHOLD`) might need tuning for different physical systems and environments.
- [ ]  **Magnetometer Disturbance Rejection:** Explore techniques for detecting and mitigating the effects of local magnetic disturbances on the MARG filter.
- [ ] Enhanced telemetry and wireless data transmission.
- [ ] Flight stabilization via more advanced thrust vector control implementation.
- [ ] Improved power management and battery monitoring.
- [ ] User-configurable settings saved to flash.
- [ ] Live data transmission via radio.
- [ ] Custom smartphone companion app for ground control.
- [ ] Advanced filtering algorithms for sensor fusion (beyond current MARG/UKF).
- [ ] Auto-diagnostics and self-testing capabilities.
- [ ] Dual-deployment redundancy systems.
