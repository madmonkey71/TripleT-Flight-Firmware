## Usage

### Basic Operation

On startup, the firmware:
1. Initializes all sensors and storage devices
2. Creates a new log file (with timestamp if GPS is available)
3. Begins collecting and logging sensor data

### Serial Commands

The firmware supports both single-character and extended commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `0`     | Toggle serial CSV output |
| `1-9`   | Toggle various debug outputs (system, IMU, GPS, barometer, etc.) |
| `a`     | Show help message |
| `b`     | Show system status |
| `f`     | Show storage statistics |
| `g`     | Toggle detailed display mode |
| `h`     | Calibrate barometer with GPS |
| `i`     | Display IMU data |
| `j`     | Toggle status summary |
| `9`     | Initiate system shutdown |
| `debug_all_off` | Disable all debugging output |
| `calibrate` | Manually calibrate barometer with GPS |
| `help`  | Show help message |
| `arm`   | Arm the flight computer (transition to ARMED state) |
| `test_error` | Simulate sensor error (for testing) |
| `test_watchdog` | Simulate watchdog timeout (for testing) |
| `clear_errors` | Reset all error flags and return to normal operation |
| `status_sensors` | Display detailed sensor status information |

### Debug Options

You can selectively enable/disable various debug outputs:

- System debug
- IMU debug
- GPS debug
- Barometer debug
- Storage debug
- ICM raw debug
- Serial CSV output

### Data Logging

Data is logged to the SD card in CSV format with the following information:
- Timestamp
- GPS information (fix type, satellites, position, altitude, speed)
- Barometric data (pressure, temperature)
- Accelerometer readings (X, Y, Z in g)
- IMU data (acceleration, gyro, magnetometer)

### Barometer Calibration

The system supports calibration of the barometric altitude using GPS data:
- Automatic calibration when a good GPS fix is available (pDOP < 3.0)
- Requires stable sensor readings before attempting calibration
- Limited to 3 attempts with 30-second intervals between attempts
- Manual calibration via the `h` command or `calibrate` command
- Visual feedback via LED (purple during calibration, green for success, red for failure)
- Detailed debug output to diagnose calibration issues
