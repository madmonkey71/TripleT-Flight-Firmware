# Web Interface Visualization Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The web interface was not displaying any visualization data despite the firmware sending well-formatted CSV data over serial.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Field Count Mismatch**: The firmware was outputting **51 CSV fields** but the web interface configuration expected only **49 fields**
2. **Missing Fields**: Two new fields added to firmware were missing from web interface configuration:
   - `BattVoltage` - Battery voltage monitoring
   - `LastErrorCode` - Error code tracking

## Serial Data Analysis
From the provided serial debug output:
```
3050,617920,1,3,6,-35.045891,138.866623,370.65,0.00,240.54,240.54,0.19,0.00,0.00,0,984.69,21.31,0.0527,-0.0703,1.0409,-0.0601,-0.0708,1.0034,-0.0081,0.0139,0.0061,335.8035,43.7701,255.7461,24.91,0.997509,-0.046219,0.047094,-0.024938,-0.095099,0.091777,-0.054360,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.5000,-0.5000,0.3000,-0.142,0.145,0.067,1.79,62
```

- **Actual field count**: 51 fields
- **Expected by web interface**: 49 fields
- **Result**: Data parser rejected all CSV data due to field count mismatch

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Data Mapping Configuration
Updated `web_interface/js/flight_console_data_mapping.json` to include missing fields:
- Added `BattVoltage` field (float, 2 decimal places)
- Added `LastErrorCode` field (integer)
- Updated `csv_headers` array to match firmware LOG_COLUMNS definition

### 2. Enhanced Web Interface
- Added battery voltage display to sensor data panel
- Updated UI updater to handle battery voltage display
- Cleaned up verbose debugging console output

### 3. File Structure
- Updated both `web_interface/js/flight_console_data_mapping.json` and copied to `web_interface/flight_console_data_mapping.json`
- Ensured configuration is accessible from main web interface directory

## Current Field Mapping (51 fields)
Based on firmware `src/log_format_definition.cpp`:

1. SeqNum, Timestamp, FlightState, FixType, Sats
2. Lat, Long, Alt, AltMSL, RawAltitude, CalibratedAltitude
3. Speed, Heading, pDOP, RTK
4. Pressure, Temperature
5. KX134_AccelX/Y/Z (3 fields)
6. ICM_AccelX/Y/Z (3 fields)
7. ICM_GyroX/Y/Z (3 fields)
8. ICM_MagX/Y/Z (3 fields)
9. ICM_Temp
10. Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3 (quaternions - 4 fields)
11. EulerRoll_rad, EulerPitch_rad, EulerYaw_rad (3 fields)
12. GyroBiasX/Y/Z_rps (3 fields)
13. TgtRoll, TgtPitch, TgtYaw (3 fields)
14. PIDIntRoll, PIDIntPitch, PIDIntYaw (3 fields)
15. ActuatorOutRoll, ActuatorOutPitch, ActuatorOutYaw (3 fields)
16. **BattVoltage** (NEW)
17. **LastErrorCode** (NEW)

## Expected Results
After this fix:
- CSV data should be properly parsed and displayed
- Real-time visualizations should show altitude, acceleration, gyroscope, and magnetometer data
- Battery voltage should be displayed in sensor data panel
- Flight state should update correctly
- 3D orientation visualizer should work with Euler angle data

## Testing
Created `test_message_filtering.html` for debugging data parsing issues and verifying the fix works correctly.

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Web interface should now properly parse and visualize all 51 fields of incoming CSV data from the TripleT Flight Firmware.
