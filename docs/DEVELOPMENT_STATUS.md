# Development Status

**Version:** v0.10.0
**Last Updated:** February 2026

## Development Status Assessment

### ✅ PRODUCTION-READY FEATURES

- ✅ **Core Sensor Integration**: GPS, Barometer, ICM-20948 (9-DOF IMU), and KX134 (High-G Accelerometer) fully integrated and operational

  - Sensor health monitoring integrated into flight state machine
  - Multi-method redundant apogee detection (barometric, accelerometer, GPS, backup timer)
  - Automatic error state transitions for sensor failures with recovery mechanisms
- ✅ **Flight State Machine**: Complete 14-state flight state machine with robust state transitions and error handling
- ✅ **State Persistence & Recovery**: EEPROM-based state saving (`FlightStateData`) with power-loss recovery capabilities
- ✅ **Parachute Deployment**: Reliable pyro channel control with multiple deployment trigger methods and dynamic main deployment altitude
- ✅ **SD Card Data Logging**: Comprehensive CSV logging including detailed GNC data (PID targets, integrals, outputs) and Kalman filter orientation
- ✅ **Interactive Serial Interface**: Feature-rich command system for diagnostics, calibration (including magnetometer), and control
- ✅ **Web Interface**: Complete real-time data visualization with Web Serial API integration
- ✅ **Orientation Filtering**: Robust Kalman filter implemented for 9-DOF sensor fusion, including magnetometer for yaw correction

- ✅ **Recovery Beacon System**: Comprehensive recovery aids including SOS audio pattern, LED strobe, and GPS coordinate beacon
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Clean, well-structured code with proper error handling and variable naming consistency

### ✅ BASIC FLIGHT CONTROL READY

- ✅ **PID Control System**: 3-axis PID controllers (configurable via `PID_ROLL_KP` etc.) with state-based activation (BOOST/COAST only)
- ✅ **Attitude Hold**: Maintains orientation captured at motor burnout (BOOST to COAST transition) using Kalman filter data
- ✅ **Actuator Integration**: PWM servo control (`ACTUATOR_PITCH_PIN`, `ACTUATOR_ROLL_PIN`, `ACTUATOR_YAW_PIN`) with configurable mapping and limits

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - MISSING FEATURES

- ❌ **Hardware reference design**: Hardware platform design is still being worked on
- ❌ **Live Telemetry**: Radio communication system not implemented (critical for operational flights). Plan exists for ESP32 bridge
- ❌ **Advanced Guidance**: Only basic attitude hold implemented; lacks trajectory following, gravity turns, wind compensation

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - ENHANCEMENTS NEEDED

- 🚧 **Sensor Fusion Validation**: Kalman filter and sensor fusion implemented, but orientation accuracy needs validation against known reference data (physical testing)
- 🚧 **Expanded Sensor Support**: Extend the platform to allow for a wider variety of sensor hardware and eventually the microprocessor platform (Long term)

## Recent Updates (v0.10.0)

- ✅ **Enhanced Recovery State**: Added visual LED strobe pattern for location assistance
- ✅ **Enhanced Recovery State**: Added GPS coordinate serial beacon output functionality
- ✅ **Battery Voltage Monitoring**: Implemented comprehensive battery voltage reading, logging, and serial debug output
- ✅ **Kalman Filter as Primary**: Kalman filter is the sole orientation filter, integrating accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data. Yaw drift corrected using tilt-compensated magnetometer
- ✅ **Magnetometer Calibration Persistence**: Bias and scale factors saved to EEPROM for persistent calibration
- ✅ **Dual Accelerometer Fusion**: Using KX134 for high-G events and ICM-20948 for normal flight operations
- ✅ **Dynamic Main Parachute Deployment**: Altitude calculated dynamically based on ground level detection

- ✅ **Code Quality Improvements**: Fixed compilation errors, improved variable naming consistency, and ensured proper function structure organization

## Compilation Status

- ✅ **All Compilation Errors Resolved**: 
  - Added missing `extern ErrorCode_t g_last_error_code;` declarations in `command_processor.cpp` and `icm_20948_functions.cpp`
  - Corrected variable naming inconsistencies in SOS pattern implementation
  - Removed duplicate static variable declarations 
  - Fixed function structure issues (functions now properly defined outside of parent functions)
  - Corrected variable name typos in GPS altitude detection
  - Fixed missing closing braces in RECOVERY case block
  - Resolved variable scope issues with case label crossing

## Current Capability Assessment
