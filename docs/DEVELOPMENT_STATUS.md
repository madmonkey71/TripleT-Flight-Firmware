### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - MISSING FEATURES

- ‚ùå **Hardware reference design**: Hardware platform design is still being worked on
- ‚ùå **Live Telemetry**: Radio communication system not implemented (critical for operational flights). Plan exists for ESP32 bridge
- ‚ùå **Advanced Guidance**: Only basic attitude hold implemented; lacks trajectory following, gravity turns, wind compensation

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - ENHANCEMENTS NEEDED

- üöß **Sensor Fusion Validation**: Kalman filter and sensor fusion implemented, but orientation accuracy needs validation against known reference data (physical testing)
- üöß **Expanded Sensor Support**: Extend the platform to allow for a wider variety of sensor hardware and eventually the microprocessor platform (Long term)

## Recent Updates (v0.51)

## Compilation Status

- ‚úÖ **All Compilation Errors Resolved**: 
  - Added missing `extern ErrorCode_t g_last_error_code;` declarations in `command_processor.cpp` and `icm_20948_functions.cpp`
  - Corrected variable naming inconsistencies in SOS pattern implementation
  - Removed duplicate static variable declarations 
  - Fixed function structure issues (functions now properly defined outside of parent functions)
  - Corrected variable name typos in GPS altitude detection
  - Fixed missing closing braces in RECOVERY case block
  - Resolved variable scope issues with case label crossing
